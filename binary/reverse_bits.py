'''
reverse bit of a given 32 bits unsigned integer

Note:
- Note that in some lanaguages, such as Java, there is no unsigned
integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as
a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation,
as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers
